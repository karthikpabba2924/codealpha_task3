📊 Sales Prediction Using Advertising Data
Machine Learning | Regression | Scenario Analysis

This project predicts Sales based on advertising spend across TV, Radio, Newspaper channels using Machine Learning.
It includes complete preprocessing, modeling, feature selection, and “what-if” analysis to understand how changes in ad spend impact sales.

This project was created with the help of AI tools and as part of my learning journey with CodeAlpha 🚀

Feature selection: SelectKBest (f_regression)
Scaling: StandardScaler

📊 Results
📌 Model Performance

(Example numbers – replace with your actual results from the notebook)

MAE: x.xx

R² Score: 0.xxx

📌 Feature Importance (Example)

TV → strongest impact

Radio → moderate impact

Newspaper → lowest impact

🔮 What-If Scenario Insights

Evaluates effect of increasing advertising budget:

+10% in all channels → 📈 Sales increase

+20% in all channels → 🚀 higher lift

+50% in TV only → strongest ROI

Newspaper spend → minimal impact

This helps optimize marketing campaigns and improve ROI.
